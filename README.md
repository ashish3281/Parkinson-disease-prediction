# Parkinson-disease-prediction
<p>
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive disorder with a presymptomatic interval; that is, there is a period during which the pathologic process has begun, but motor signs required for the clinical diagnosis are absent. There is considerable interest in discovering markers to diagnose this preclinical stage. Current predictive marker development stems mainly from two principles; first, that pathologic processes occur in lower brainstem regions before substantia nigra involvement and second, that redundancy and compensatory responses cause symptoms to emerge only after advanced degeneration. Decreased olfaction has recently been demonstrated to predict PD in prospective pathologic studies, although the lead time may be relatively short and the positive predictive value and specificity are low. Screening patients for depression and personality changes, autonomic symptoms, subtle motor dysfunction on quantitative testing, sleepiness and insomnia are other potential simple markers. More invasive measures such as detailed autonomic testing, cardiac MIBG-scintigraphy, transcranial ultrasound, and dopaminergic functional imaging may be especially useful in those at high risk or for further defining risk in those identified through primary screening. Despite intriguing leads, direct testing of preclinical markers has been limited, mainly because there is no reliable way to identify preclinical disease. Idiopathic RBD is characterized by loss of normal atonia with REM sleep. Approximately 50% of affected individuals will develop PD or dementia within 10 years. This provides an unprecedented opportunity to test potential predictive markers before clinical disease onset. The results of marker testing in idiopathic RBD with its implications for disease prediction will be detailed.</p>

<h2>Importing Libraries and Dataset</h2>

<p>Python libraries make it very easy for us to handle the data and perform typical and complex tasks with a single line of code.
</p>
Pandas – This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format and has multiple functions to perform analysis tasks in one go.
Numpy – Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations in a very short time.
Matplotlib/Seaborn – This library is used to draw visualizations.
Sklearn – This module contains multiple libraries having pre-implemented functions to perform tasks from data preprocessing to model development and evaluation.
XGBoost – This contains the eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm which is one of the algorithms which helps us to achieve high accuracy on predictions.
Imblearn – This module contains a function that can be used for handling problems related to data imbalance.
